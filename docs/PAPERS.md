# Papers

The testing approaches implemented in SQLancer are described in the three papers below.

## Testing Database Engines via Pivoted Query Synthesis

This paper describes PQS, a testing approach to detect various kinds of logic bugs in DBMS. A preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04174.pdf).

## Detecting Optimization Bugs in Database Engines via Non-Optimizing Reference Engine Construction

This paper describes NoREC, a metamorphic testing approach to detect optimization bugs, that is, logic bugs that affect the query optimizer. A preprint is available [here](https://www.manuelrigger.at/preprints/NoREC.pdf).

## Ternary Logic Partitioning: Detecting Logic Bugs in Database Management Systems

This paper describes TLP, a metamorphic testing approach that can detect various kinds of logic bugs and is applicable also test features such as aggregate functions. A preprint is available [here](https://www.manuelrigger.at/preprints/TLP.pdf).
